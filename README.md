# EHR-Analysis
Generally, all the information (symptoms, diagnosis, medical tests, etc.)That hospitals record from patients are done by general practitioners in a daily basis are kept at Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The data which is stored is Hand-Written which is in the form of a natural language content. Itâ€™s difficult for the research. If we use this data to build a model which is capable to bring out the data which would help in the advancement of biomedical research. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) Models, have shown exceptional leads to historically unsolved natural language processing issues, together with some info Extraction tasks like the Slot Filling and the Relation Classification.
